- Proper DAG/topological order for schematics
- Proper white TAS (currently using wool texture)
- Add wire and tube costs for schematics
- Manual :(
- Various models and textures
- GUI for panel creation (tape-based is cool but annoying)
- More panel components
- More cells
- Sequencer (see Design.md)
