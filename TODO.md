- More panel components
    - Key switch:
        - How to do keying? Should not be synced to clientâ€¦
        - Maybe lock+key as thing that can be inserted into a panel, and removal only with key inserted and turned?
          Similar to door locks
    - Seven Segments?
    - Scope????? Probably not, but some form of scope/LA would be nice at some point
- More cells
- Loot tables
- Energy requirements for panel layout/creation
    - or just change the texture and be done with it
- Tape-to-book machine (Tape printer or similar)
- Double-check the lower/upper left corner stuff in the panel format entry
