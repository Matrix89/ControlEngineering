Keypunch

<&recipe>The keypunch can be used to create punched tapes. Empty tape can be added or removed by clicking on the tape role, punched tape can be retrieved from the box on the other side. The keypunch has two modes, loopback and remote transmission. Use the switch at the back to change the current mode.
In loopback mode (the default) the characters typed in the GUI are punched on the tape of the same keypunch. This can be useful for manually creating or modifying control panels designs.
In remote transmission mode the typed characters will be transmitted through the bus port at the back. The first 8 colors (white to gray) are used for the data bits, the next color (light gray) is used as a clock signal. The clock signal is compatible with a <link;controlengineering:clocks;rising edge clock;edge>. Additionally, characters received from the same bus port are punched on the tape. This can be used to build long-range communication systems and to capture the output of machines like the <link;controlengineering:panel_cnc;control panel CNC>.
