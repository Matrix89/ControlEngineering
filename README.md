Control Engineering is an addon for Immersive Engineering focusing on redstone control and automation. Its main
features are control panels and logic cabinets.

**Control panels** offer a compact way to control and monitor various redstone signals using various different
components like buttons, variacs, panel meters and many more. Panel designs are stored on **Punched Tape** and then
created using the **Control Panel CNC**. This allows existing designs to easily be replicated and modified. The tape
designs can either be written out manually using a **Keypunch** or created in the visual interface of the **Panel
Designer**.

Logic cabinets are an independent take on redstone logic in IEs visual style. Unlike the logic units added by IE, these
support analog signals, but also require power to keep them running.
